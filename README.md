# Datafold VSCode Extension Demo: Data Diffs

This is a demo for how to use the [Datafold VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Datafold.datafold-vscode&ssr=false#overview) to compare data between your development and production environments with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).

Our team at [Datafold](https://datafold.com/) built this extension to help data teams move faster and with more confidence when shipping data. We hope you find it useful!
